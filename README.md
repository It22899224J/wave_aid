The `Expo Starter Template` is a free project model with up-to-date frameworks and configurations for your new Expo project. It helps eliminate repetitive tasks when starting a project from scratch. This template integrates carefully selected libraries to help you bootstrap your new React Native and Expo app with the most effective frameworks and tools available in the market.

The project integrates universal version of [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components, Tailwind styling, state management, and a local-first database strategy for universal mobile apps on Android, iOS, and Web.
